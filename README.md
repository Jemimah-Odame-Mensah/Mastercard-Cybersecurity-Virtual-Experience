# Phishing Campaign & Awareness Training

This documentation details my work on the Phishing Campaign Simulation, completed through Mastercard’s Cybersecurity Virtual Experience on Forage. In this simulation, I worked as an analyst in the Security Awareness Team, where I was responsible for designing and running a phishing simulation to raise cybersecurity awareness within Mastercard. The goal was to create realistic phishing emails, analyze employee responses, and design targeted training to mitigate future risks.

## Project Overview

Phishing is a common and costly threat to organizations worldwide. As an analyst in the Security Awareness Team, my role was to lead a phishing simulation designed to test employees’ susceptibility to phishing emails and provide feedback to improve security practices.

The simulation aimed to educate Mastercard employees on how to detect and avoid phishing attempts, particularly as phishing attacks become more sophisticated. My tasks ranged from designing realistic phishing emails to interpreting the results of the simulation to determine which teams required additional training.

## Key Contributions and Tasks

### 1. Designing a Believable Phishing Email:

- To kick off the simulation, I was tasked with improving an obvious fake phishing email. The original email lacked context and credibility, making it easy for employees to identify.
    - I recreated the email to make it more convincing by:
    - Adding relevant context about suspicious activity on the recipient’s account to make it more likely they would take action.
    - Masking the phishing link within legitimate-looking text (e.g., "Review Activity") to increase the chances of the recipient clicking the link.
    - Ensuring the email appeared professional, with proper spelling, grammar, and a more legitimate sender address (e.g., ITDepartment@mastercard.com).

### 2. Analyzing the Results of the Phishing Simulation:

- After running the phishing simulation, I analyzed the email open rates, click-through rates, and phishing success rates across various departments. The results helped identify which teams were most vulnerable to phishing attempts:
    - *HR Department*: Had the highest phishing success rate, indicating a critical need for additional training.
    - *Marketing and Card Services Departments*: Also displayed a higher-than-average phishing success rate, suggesting they needed targeted training to reduce risks.
- Using the data, I provided insights on which teams needed more awareness about phishing threats and which were relatively secure.

### 3. Security Awareness Training:

- Based on the simulation results, I designed and implemented a security awareness training program tailored to the two most vulnerable teams (HR and Marketing). The training focused on:
    - Educating employees on how to spot phishing emails, emphasizing subtle tactics that attackers use, such as masked links and urgent-sounding language.
    - Reinforcing the importance of reporting suspicious emails to IT immediately, rather than interacting with them.
- I created a short, impactful presentation that included real examples from the phishing simulation to demonstrate the risks and educate employees on avoiding future threats.
